#+title: My Stylix Element Themes

** What is this repo?
Themes corresponding to all of my stylix themes which can be found at any of the following mirrors:
- [[https://gitlab.com/librephoenix/nixos-config/-/tree/main/themes?ref_type=heads][GitLab]]
- [[https://github.com/librephoenix/nixos-config/tree/main/themes][GitHub]]
- [[https://codeberg.org/librephoenix/nixos-config/src/branch/main/themes][Codeberg]]

I made this because I couldn't get Element themes to load locally :(

** Usage
First, make sure Labs are enabled in your Element's =config.json=:
#+begin_src json
{
    "show_labs_settings": true
}
#+end_src

Next, enable "Support adding custom themes" (=feature_custom_themes=) in the Labs section of your settings.

Lastly, you can import any theme you want by going to the Appearance section of your settings, and pasting a raw url to any json theme in this repository.
