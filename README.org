#+title: My Stylix Element Themes

** What is this repo?
Themes corresponding to all of my stylix themes which can be found at any of the following mirrors:
- [[https://gitlab.com/librephoenix/nixos-config/-/tree/main/themes?ref_type=heads][GitLab]]
- [[https://github.com/librephoenix/nixos-config/tree/main/themes][GitHub]]
- [[https://codeberg.org/librephoenix/nixos-config/src/branch/main/themes][Codeberg]]

I made this because I couldn't get Element themes to load locally :(
